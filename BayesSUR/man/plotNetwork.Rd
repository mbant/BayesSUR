\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{BayesSUR}}

\item{includeResponse}{A vector of the response names which are shown in the network}

\item{excludeResponse}{A vector of the response names which are not shown in the network}

\item{includePredictor}{A vector of the predictor names which are shown in the network}

\item{excludePredictor}{A vector of the predictor names which are not shown in the network}

\item{MatrixGamma}{A matrix or dataframe of the latent indicator variable. Default is \code{NULL} and to extrate it from object of class inheriting from an object of class "BayesSUR"}

\item{PmaxPredictor}{cutpoint for thresholding the estimated latent indicator variable. Default is 0.5}

\item{PmaxResponse}{cutpoint for thresholding the learning structure matrix of multiple response variables. Default is 0.5}

\item{nodesizePredictor}{node size of Predictors in the output graph. Default is 15}

\item{nodesizeResponse}{node size of response variables in the output graph. Default is 25}

\item{no.isolates}{remove isolated nodes from responses graph and Full graph, may get problem if there are also isolated Predictors}

\item{lineup}{A ratio of the heights between responses' area and Predictors'}

\item{gray.alpha}{the opacity. The default is 0.6}

\item{edgewith.response}{the edge width between response nodes}

\item{edgewith.predictor}{the edge width between the predictor and response node}

\item{edge.weight}{draw weighted edges after thresholding at 0.5. The defaul value \code{FALSE} is not to draw weighted edges}

\item{label.predictor}{A vector of the names of predictors}

\item{label.response}{A vector of the names of response variables}

\item{color.predictor}{color of the predictor nodes}

\item{color.response}{color of the response nodes}

\item{name.predictors}{A subtitle for the predictors}

\item{name.responses}{A subtitle for the responses}

\item{vertex.frame.color}{color of the frame of the vertices. If you don't want vertices to have a frame, supply NA as the color name}

\item{layoutInCircle}{place vertices on a circle, in the order of their vertex ids. The default is \code{FALSE}}
